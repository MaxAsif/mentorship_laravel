						The Mentoring Relationship

					<hr>
					<div class="well collapse" id="twoFour">
						For mentoring to be successful there must be a reciprocal and comfortable relationship between the mentor and the mentee. Both parties must work to make the relationship successful by being open-minded, respectful and keeping to the expectations they have set for the relationship. Ideally, the mentor-mentee relationship will be a mutually beneficial one, as the mentor learns from the mentee and the mentee from the mentor.

						<h3>Don’t ask, "Will you be my mentor"</h3>
						<p>Mentorship relationships start with a mutual connection-and mentors often select mentee based on their performance and potential. So shift your thinking from "If I get a mentor, I’ll excel" to "If I excel, I will get a mentor." You will be allotted alumni mentors whose career path aligns with your goals.</p>

						<h3>Mentoring—it’s never too early</h3>
						<p>No matter what stage you’re at in your career, you can mentor a student. If you’re farther along in your career, pay it forward by investing in a student’s just starting out. And if you’re early in your career, find a student who’s coming up behind you or a student who’s interested in your field. Don’t underestimate the value of your input-you may have just been through what they are experiencing.</p>

						<h3 id="sub">Your mentor’s time is valuable-treat it that way</h3>
						<p>Show your mentor you value his/her time by using it wisely. Avoid meeting or calling just to catch up or asking questions you can find answers to yourself. Instead, come to them with thoughtful questions and be ready to discuss real challenges you’re facing. Then listen carefully to their recommendations and report back on your progress.  The mentor is more likely to continue to invest in you if you’re acting on the input—and the impact on your career is visible.</p>

				<div class="col-md-6 para-right">

						<h3 id="circle">Mentor</h3>
						<h3>Invest in your mentee's success</h3>
						<p>Commit time and energy to developing your mentee. Make yourself available and take the time to understand their questions and give them thoughtful and thorough input. Ask your mentee for regular updates. The more you understand his/her progress—and what’s working and what's not, the more effective you can be as a mentor. If the mentee is not using your time wisely, be clear about your expectations and set guidelines for your time together. You'll both benefit from getting into a good rhythm.</p>

						<h3>View feedback as a gift</h3>
						<p>Make sure you don’t fall into the trap of not providing with honest feedback with your mentor. Solicit the feedback whenever you can by asking specific questions like, “How can I improve?” and “What am I not doing that I should be?” The more you ask for and accept their feedback, the faster you’ll learn—and odds are they’ll respect your openness and willingness to grow.</p>

						<h3>Give open, honest input-even when it’s hard</h3>
						<p>Direct, actionable feedback is a gift. Look for opportunities to give your mentee specific input for improving performance and learning new skills. Whenever possible, share your input in the moment, when it’s most effective. If you hold back to protect your mentee’s feelings, you’re not helping them. Remember, your honest feedback will help them advance more quickly.<br> <br> <br></p>
