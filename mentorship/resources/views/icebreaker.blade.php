	<hr>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">Students' Alumni Cell conducted the first ever Ice Breaker session to start the interaction between the mentors and the mentees. Ice Breaker session helps the mentee to set a good rapport with their mentors and solves the problem of lack of communication. We saw a great enthusiasm of students and the alumni mentors for this event.<br>
	Here is the pool of experiences shared by the mentees who made their first call breaking the ice and initiating a promising journey. </p>

			<p style="font-size: 25px">   It was wonderful. My mentor was very friendly and interactive. He suggested me to mail or call him any time if I need any guidance. I definitely plan to have a lot of future interactions with him and make the best out of his lifetime of experience.
